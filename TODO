## CRITICAL
* Ð¡reate base backups
* Human frendly notification
* Notify when cluster was restored after the failing in monitoring phase

## MEDIUM 
* Pluggable monitoring
* Pluggable notification
* Initialize replica from WAL files first
* New master selection

## LOW
* Multireplica support
* Consistent naming, everything have "pg3-" prefix except cluster name
* Unify the way how params are stored in labels. `(get-in res [:metadata :labels :service])` should work for any resource.
* Why we use service name for pginstances search pg3.utils:10
* Liveness probes
* Readiness probes
